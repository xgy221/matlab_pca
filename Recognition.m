function OutputName = Recognition(TestImage, m, A, Eigenfaces)
% Recognizing step....
%
% Description: This function compares two faces by projecting the images into facespace and 
% measuring the Euclidean distance between them.
%
% Argument:      TestImage              - Path of the input test image
%
%                m                      - (M*Nx1) Mean of the training
%                                         database, which is output of 'EigenfaceCore' function.
%
%                Eigenfaces             - (M*Nx(P-1)) Eigen vectors of the
%                                         covariance matrix of the training
%                                         database, which is output of 'EigenfaceCore' function.
%
%                A                      - (M*NxP) Matrix of centered image
%                                         vectors, which is output of 'EigenfaceCore' function.
% 
% Returns:       OutputName             - Name of the recognized image in the training database.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Projecting centered image vectors into facespace
% All centered images are projected into facespace by multiplying in
% Eigenface basis's. Projected vector of each face will be its corresponding
% feature vector.

ProjectedImages = [];
Train_Number = size(A,2);
for i = 1 : Train_Number
    temp = Eigenfaces'*A(:,i); % Projection of centered images into facespace将每个样本投影到特征空间
    ProjectedImages = [ProjectedImages temp]; 
end

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Extracting the PCA features from test image
InputImage = imread(TestImage);
%temp = InputImage(:,:,1);
temp = InputImage;

[irow icol] = size(temp);
InImage = reshape(temp',irow*icol,1);
Difference = double(InImage)-m; % Centered test image
ProjectedTestImage = Eigenfaces'*Difference; % Test image feature vector将待测样本投影到特征空间

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Calculating Euclidean distances
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 按照欧式距离取最小的原则得出匹配的人脸
% Euclidean distances between the projected test image and the projection
% of all centered training images are calculated. Test image is
% supposed to have minimum distance with its corresponding image in the
% training database.
